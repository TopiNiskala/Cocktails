# Cocktails
PHP tutorial program. List and create cocktails with PHP and databases.
To successfully install this program on your server do following:

  1) Change your own database credentials to the <code>config/database.php</code> file.
  2) Run the create.sql codes in your MySQL to set up the database.
  3) You might have to install PDO support for your database server. (Instructions here: http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php)
  4) If you need some inputs to the database as testdata, I have a .sql.gz file that can be exported to MySQL. 
  
  Currently the only bugs remaining in the program are the few javascript errors from youtube/vimeo iframes.
